You're in for a bad time Addison - As always, I'd set as much as possible, and then tone it back.
First, you want to check the UEFI settings, and make sure that they're good. There might be a few.
You don't need to shutdown the computer in any special way, depending on the motherboard.
If it can wake from S4 (deepest sleep), and S5 (complete poweroff), then that's what you want.
You need to make sure that the ethernet device is still blinking, even while the PC is off.
To do that, the following settings will be needed:
Don't bother with fancy scripts to send wake-on-lan packets. Just apt install wakeonlan.


1)
Make sure that `/etc/default/halt` contains:

```
NETDOWN=no
```

2)
Make a file here `/etc/systemd/network/50-wired.link`, or something similar.
Check that other ones don't override it.

```
[Match]
MACAddress=70:85:c2:7c:13:96

[Link]
Name=eno1
WakeOnLan=magic
```

3)
Use ethtool to check the status of your device, and enable/disable listening TEMPORARILY:

	# List info about <eno1> device
	sudo ethtool eno1

	# Set Wake On Lan for magic packet only. man ethtool for more.
	sudo ethtool -s eno1 wol g

You may need to make this run on start^
Strangely, i did not end up running this anywhere - it appears that the previous was enough
If you want to, the ethtool command can go in /etc/network/interfaces (google how)
It can also go in other /etc/ things that run on boot, so I hear

4)
Getting desperate? This is probably unneeded, but you can try this. I actually did it, so maybe it's needed.

	nmcli connection modify "MY_NET_CONN" 802-3-ethernet.wake-on-lan magic



I initially made some changes to these files, but in the end, no changes were needed to:

	/etc/default/acpi-support

	/etc/default/acpid

	/etc/network/interfaces

Good luck
